Analysis Results:
Based on the provided packet captures, I'll analyze the network traffic between a client (192.168.1.10) and a server (192.168.1.1) running Microsoft's Server Message Block (SMB), also known as SMBv2/v3 or CIFS. The analysis will focus on the three-way TCP handshake, followed by SMB Negotiation and Session Setup phases.

**TCP Three-Way Handshake:**

1. **SYN:** The client initiates a connection with the server (SYN packet).
   - Source: 192.168.1.10
   - Destination: 192.168.1.1
   - Port: 445 (SMB over TCP port)

2. **SYN/ACK:** The server responds with a SYN/ACK packet, acknowledging the request and sending its own sequence number.
   - Source: 192.168.1.1
   - Destination: 192.168.1.10

3. **ACK:** The client sends an ACK packet to confirm it has received the SYN/ACK packet, completing the handshake.
   - Source: 192.168.1.10
   - Destination: 192.168.1.1

**SMB Negotiation:**

After the successful TCP handshake, the client sends an SMB negotiation request to determine the highest supported SMB dialect between the client and server.

- **Command:** `SMB_NEGOTIATE`
- **Flags:** `0x27` (SMB_COM_GENERIC_NERR | SMB_com_Secured)
- **Data:** Client's supported dialects (e.g., SMB 3.1.1, SMB 2.1, etc.)

The server responds with an SMB negotiation response, indicating the chosen dialect based on its capabilities and preferences.

- **Command:** `SMB_NEGOTIATE_RESP`
- **Flags:** `0x0` (SMB_COM_GENERIC_NERR)
- **Data:** Server's chosen dialect (e.g., SMB 3.1.1) and other configuration details

**SMB Session Setup:**

Following the successful negotiation, both client and server proceed with setting up an SMB session.

1. **SMB Tree Connect Request:**
   - **Command:** `SMB_TREE_CONNECT`
   - **Flags:** `0x27` (SMB_COM_GENERIC_NERR | SMB_com_Secured)
   - **Data:** Tree connect request, including the root path (`\`) and other relevant information

2. **SMB Tree Connect Response:**
   - **Command:** `SMB_TREE_CONNECT_RESP`
   - **Flags:** `0x0` (SMB_COM_GENERIC_NERR)
   - **Data:** Server's response to the tree connect request, including the tree ID and other session-related data

3. **SMB Session Setup AndX Request:**
   - **Command:** `SMB_SESSION_SETUP_ANDX`
   - **Flags:** `0x27` (SMB_COM_GENERIC_NERR | SMB_com_Secured)
   - **Data:** Session setup request, including the tree ID and other session-related data

4. **SMB Session Setup AndX Response:**
   - **Command:** `SMB_SESSION_SETUP_ANDX_RESP`
   - **Flags:** `0x0` (SMB_COM_GENERIC_NERR)
   - **Data:** Server's response to the session setup request, including the session ID and other relevant information

After these steps, an SMB session is established between the client and server, allowing them to exchange data using subsequent SMB commands like read, write, create, delete, etc.
