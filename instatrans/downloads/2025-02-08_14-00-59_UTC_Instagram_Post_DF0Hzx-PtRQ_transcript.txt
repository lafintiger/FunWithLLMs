In Qigong, there's a practice called the healing sounds. Let me show you one of

2
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:11,750
the six healing sounds. And this is for the lungs. We're gonna make a Z sound.

3
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:19,190
And that'll vibrate the chest and help to purge out any illness, especially a

4
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:23,050
respiratory illness. So we come up like this with the hands. Take a breath.

5
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:30,410
Hands up over the head. The lung meridian goes to your thumbs. We're

6
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:36,750
going to make that Z sound. You want to feel it vibrating in your chest.

7
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:49,010
And imagine your lungs are filled with bright white light, re-establishing the

8
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:54,230
natural power of the lungs and the respiratory system, the healing energy.
